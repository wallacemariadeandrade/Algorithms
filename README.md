# Algorithms

A project to study and implement interesting kind of algorithms, like sorting algorithms, cryptographic algorithms, shuffle algorithms, random numbers generators algorithms and so on. :sunglasses:

The purpose is to implement in a generalized way, that is, using programming languages common features like loops, if/else, recursion and so on. I believe this way it'll be easier for people to study it.

## Sorting Algorithms

Each algorithm was implemented with two approaches: "classic" (to sort only integers) and generic (to sort anything comparable). 

Dive into [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/wallacemariadeandrade/Algorithms/tree/master/SortingAlgorithms) folder and have fun! :smile:
