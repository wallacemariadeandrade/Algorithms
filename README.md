# Algorithms

A project to study and implement interesting kind of algorithms, like sorting algorithms, cryptographic algorithms, shuffle algorithms, random numbers generators algorithms and so on. :sunglasses:

The purpose is to implement in a generalized way, that is, using programming languages common features like loops, if/else, recursion and so on. I believe this way it'll be easier for people to study it.
