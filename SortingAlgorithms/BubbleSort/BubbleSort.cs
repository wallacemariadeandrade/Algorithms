    /// From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort):
    /// Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that 
    /// repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are 
    /// in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 
    /// The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements 
    /// "bubble" to the top of the list.
    /// Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2), where n is the number of 
    /// items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case 
    /// or average complexity, often O(n log n). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as 
    /// insertion sort, generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex. Therefore, 
    /// bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.
    ///
    /// Bubble sort should be avoided in the case of large collections. It will not be efficient in the case of a reverse-ordered collection.
